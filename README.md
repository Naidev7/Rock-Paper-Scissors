# Rock Paper Scissors Game
Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game project developed entirely with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS! This project was created when I first started learning JavaScript, aiming to work with the various common methods and functionalities of JavaScript in a simple and entertaining practice.

## Project Overview
This project implements the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors using basic JavaScript functionalities. It allows users to play against the computer by selecting their choice of rock, paper, or scissors, and then compares it with the computer's random choice to determine the winner.

## How to Use the Game
Clone the Repository:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rock-paper-scissors.git
```

2. Open the Game
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to start playing the game.

## Game Instructions
Select your choice of rock, paper, or scissors by clicking on the corresponding button.
The computer will randomly choose its option.
The winner will be determined based on the classic rules of the game:
- Rock crushes scissors.
- Scissors cuts paper.
- Paper covers rock.

## Enhancements and Learning
While this project is a simple implementation of Rock Paper Scissors, it served as a valuable learning experience for me as I familiarized myself with JavaScript fundamentals. I practiced working with DOM manipulation, event handling, and conditional statements, among other common JavaScript functionalities.

### Acknowledgments
I want to thank everyone who has supported me in my journey of learning JavaScript. Your encouragement and feedback have been invaluable to my growth as a developer.

## Conclusion
I hope you enjoy playing the Rock Paper Scissors game! Feel free to explore the codebase and make any modifications or enhancements you see fit. Happy gaming! ðŸŽ®
